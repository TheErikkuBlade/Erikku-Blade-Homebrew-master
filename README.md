# Instructions for Integrations

Many of the homebrew provided here are currently only integrated for the use of the 5eTools site.
However, I intend to add PDF versions of my homebrew content in addition to the 5eTools Integration!

I'm just now setting up this repository to be intended for public viewing, but I also have extremely poor time-management and a College Studnet
So Updates will be slow! Thank you for understanding!

Hope you all enjoy the content anyhow!

Instructions for Integrating my Homebrew to 5eTools, BetteR20, and Plutonium:

5eTools Site Integration:

1. Navigate to the JSON you want to integrate into the 5eTools Site and click on it.
2. There should be two buttons to look at "Raw" or "Blame" versions of the file. Click on "Raw".
3. It should take you to another tab and you'll see a white screen with a bunch of code, ignore than and copy the URL to the Tab.
4. Go to the 5eTools Site.
5. Go to the Utilities Tab on the top of the site and click the dropdown.
6. Go to "Homebrew Manager".
7. Click "Load From URL" and Paste the copied URL from Step 3.
8. Hit OK.
9. Enjoy your Homebrew!
10. Repeat Steps 1-9 for each homebrew you want to integrate, my suggestion is that if the option is available in one of the Compendiums, integrate the Compendium file.

BetteR20:

1. Repeat Steps 1-3 of the 5eTools Site Integration
2. When you open the importer on Roll20, be sure to choose "Custom" for the source and paste the copied URL.
3. Import as normal.
4. Enjoy your Homebrew!

Plutonium:
1. Repeat Steps 1-3 of the 5eTools Site Integration
2. When you use the Plutonium Importer, navigate normally to your desired importer for Classes & Subclasses, Items, Spells, etc.
3. When choosing your sources, there should be an option for "Custom URL", make sure that check box is checked
4. On the left-hand side, there should now be a "URL Sources:" with a button to "Add Custom", click on that.
5. A new bar below it will be created, paste the Copied URL.
6. Repeat for all desired Homebrew.
7. Enjoy your Homebrew!
