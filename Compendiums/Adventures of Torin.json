However, his gentleness is tempered with the will to do what is necessary in order to protect those around him. He will not hold back against someone who uses awesome power to destroy others. He is always willing to give a second chance, however. Usually allowing most of his foes an opportunity of redemption. Most do not take this opportunity, but those that have became powerful allies to Erikku and are now some of many protectors of Torrin.",

And even then they were separated for a good amount of their lives. However, Erikku's deeds would go to have the queen of the elves, Lia Elvenwood, to be in his debt. Using her last wish, she returned Erikku's parents to him, who now live with him in his retirement in the Town of New Edam.",

He honed this ability using his training as a monk in a monastery and furthered delved into magic by attuning to his mother's roots as a druid. He is an excellent combination between being a trained warrior, to being a compassionate healer. A perfect combination of his parents."

        "Blood magic is often used by worshipers of evil gods, demons, or arch devils. Rarely though, some are born to be a blood mage through demonic or devilish origins. Tieflings are strong candidates for becoming blood mages, but anyone of any racial origin has the potential for it. A blood mage is often seen as a sign of some powerful demon or devil seeping into the material plane and killing a blood mage is often associated with keeping said demon or devil in their respective planes. As such, natural born blood mages are hunted and killed."
