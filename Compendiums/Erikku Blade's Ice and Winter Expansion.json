        "When a creature fails a saving throw against one of your 1st level or higher spells that deals cold damage, you can mark that creature with a chilling brand. While marked with this brand, ice and frost slowly creeps into their body, granting them vulnerability to all damage until the end of your next turn. This renders any resistance or immunities they had useless until the effect fades. Once they next take damage after being marked, the frozen brand melts away, ending the effect. A creature is immune to the effects of this mark if they have resistance or immunity to cold damage.",
