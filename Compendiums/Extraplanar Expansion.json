They have an insatiable craving for the blood of mortals, beguiling victims to come close to their lair in order to drain them. They are commonly mistaken for vampires because of their bloodsucking technique, but they are not undead.",
          "Glaistigs resemble incredibly attractive female humans or half-elves, but instead of normal legs, they have goat legs with long, white fur. Most have snow-white hair and eyes that shimmer like water. When they smile, glaistigs try not to show their teeth, which are sharpened to cruel-looking fangs and revealed only when they are about to strike. Glaistigs wear long, fine robes and dresses that drape along the ground, which are used to hide their legs. Glaistigs loathe showing their legs to anyone, and will only reveal them to lash out in anger. If someone catches sight of a glaistig’s goat legs, it will become very angered and attack the offender.",
          "Despite their single-minded lust for blood, glaistigs are unpredictable and capricious. If they have recently fed (say, within a month) then they are just as likely to help someone as they are to attack. More than a few people have been attacked by a glaistig, even if it has talked and been friendly to them in the past. Glaistigs also enjoy dancing, and some lure their victims to caper and dance for many hours before attacking them.",
          "Glaistigs are solitary by nature and do not even like other fey all that much. While they gain no sustenance from the blood of sylvan creatures, glaistigs have been known to attack fey that come too close into their territory. Perhaps because of their similar nature, glaistigs in particular do not like dryads, and it is extremely rare to find the two beings in the same territory. ",

It shares your initiative but moves and takes actions either right before or after your turn. If you are reduced to 0 hit points and are knocked unconscious, your connection to the planar ally ends and it returns to the plane from once it came. You can use an action and spend a spell slot of any level to summon it again, but it returns with the hit points and conditions it had prior to returning to its plane.",
