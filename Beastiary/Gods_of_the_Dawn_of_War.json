She provides and tends the Weave, the conduit through which mortal spellcasters and magical crafters can safely access the raw force of magic.",

Her worshipers include those who use magic or work closely with it, such as alchemists and sages. The blue-clad priests of Mystran temples count wizards and sorcerers among their numbers, as well as the occasional bard. The goal of Mystra's faithful is simple: that magic be preserved and promulgated throughout the Realms. It isn't unusual for her followers to keep an eye out for those who demonstrate high potential for using magic and help arrange for such persons to find tutelage with a suitable mentor.",
					"Mystra (pronounced MISS-trah), the Mother of all Magic, formerly known as Midnight, was once a greater goddess who guided the magic that enveloped Toril and its surrounding space. Though now with her resurrection and faith having been lost in the weave and magic as a whole, her power is far less than it had been. Mystra tends to the Weave constantly, making possible all the miracles and mysteries wrought by magic and users of magic. She is believed to be the embodiment of the Weave and of magic itself, though this is now known to be false in the wake of the Spellplague. When the weave collapsed with her death, magic still existed, but in a different form as before. Adaptation was forced on society, and magic users still found ways to use their power, though it had taken far more work and could cause chaos since the wild forms of magic were more prevalent.",
					"With her resurrection and the re-establishment of the weave, magic is now easier to control and use, but time and distrust makes it less of worth-while pursuit than it had been before, and many users still prefer the more wild uses that were established during the time of the spellplague."

				"entries": [
					"The Church of Avandra represents one of the most open, tolerant, and accepting of all the different faiths. One of the core tenets of the faith demands open-mindedness and the willingness to learn new things.",
					"Overall, Avandra’s faith has little in the way of formal ritual, liturgy, or hierarchy. Followers of Avandra are amongst the most individualistic of any faith, and the same holds true for her clergy.",
					"In general, people call upon Avandra either for aid or to give thanks as they live moment to moment. Worship of Avandra seldom centers on a temple, incense, or other trappings of religion. As a result, her overall church remains relatively small, disorganized, and thus lacks the power or influence of larger churches. Instead of congregations, worship of Avandra involves individuals or small groups, usually as they travel or explore.",
					"Spheres of Influence: Change, luck, travelers, trade, adventurers, wanderers, seekers, the lost",
					"Avatar: According to legend, the Goddess of Change vastly prefers exploring and traveling the Middle World or the Feywild to living in her domain in the Astral Sea. As long as she does not directly intervene in mortal affairs (at least not in a major way), she avoids breaking the Covenant or angering other gods.",
					"Avandra’s avatar is frequently female, often half-elf or elven in appearance. She typically wears rugged traveling clothes and carries a well-worn walking staff. It is also believed she sometimes travels as a large owl when she wishes to fly.",
					"Signs & Portents: The appearance of landmark, milestone, or clue leading to civilization to the lost is frequently hailed as a sign from Avandra. Likewise, the unexpected appearance of a source of water, food, or shelter in the midst of the wilderness signals Avandra’s blessings. Avandra reveals her displeasure in dark storm clouds and angry winds.",
					"Tenets of the Faith: Luck favors the bold. Take your fate into your own hands, and Avandra smiles upon you. Avandra calls upon her priests and worshippers to practice self-reliance as much as possible, and to teach this same attribute to others. If you wait for someone else to do what needs to be done or meet your needs, you are likely to wait for a long time. At times, opportunity demands risk and boldness, and followers of Avandra must be prepared to act.",
					"Strike back against those who would rob you of your freedom and urge others to fight for their own liberty. Avandra’s faith promotes freedom as one of the most important parts of life. Without freedom, all things lose importance and value. Clerics of Avandra must, when necessary, fight to protect their freedoms.",
					"Travel whenever and wherever possible. In Avandra’s faith, travel represents one of the best ways to learn and gain experience. As a cleric travels, he gains an appreciation for his own customs, as well as those of other cultures. Travel broadens the mind, challenges the body, and promotes learning.",
					"Aid the lost or forlorn. A cleric of Avandra is duty-bound to assist those in need when possible. Most often, this applies to individuals lost, either physically or spiritually. The cleric of Avandra is expected to share his fortune to the benefit of others.",
					"Change is inevitable, but it takes the work of the faithful to ensure that change is for the better. Avandra’s faith holds high regard for the concept of tolerance towards and acceptance of other creatures and their beliefs. Her worshippers are taught to avoid being close-minded, intolerant, or prejudiced of something merely because it is different. There are a number of reasons for the importance of this tenet, not the least of which is the inevitability of change. As the saying goes, change is the only constant. Followers of Avandra must accept this fact and use their faith and goodwill to create change for the better. Her worshippers must remain open to change, and always look for opportunities in change.",
					"Avoid violent conflict when possible. Although it would be a mistake to label Avandra as a pacifistic deity, her faith promotes peaceful interactions whenever and wherever possible. The goddess certainly allows for self-defense and protecting the innocent or helpless, but her faith teaches the value of compromise and negotiation when possible. That being said, her clerics are expected to fight for freedom, and to encourage others to do likewise. At times, negotiation and compromise are out of the question, and action is called for.",
					"Waste nothing. Also central to Avandra’s teachings is the concept of not wasting anything. If you hunt and kill, do not kill more than you can eat. If you must cut down trees for firewood, cut down only what is absolutely necessary. Waste is considered a sin in Avandra’s eyes.",
					"Holy Symbol: Three-fold wave of forest green",
					"Place of Worship: Roadside shrines, impromptu outdoor chapels. There are relatively few permanent temples dedicated to Avandra; her clergy do not see any great need for large buildings or impressive structures. To the followers of the Goddess of Change, the best place to worship is when the need arises, regardless of where you are at the moment. Worship services dedicated to Avandra are usually brief, simple, and yet elegant.",
					"Canon: The Wayfarer’s Journal. Avandra’s “bible” represents one of the most unorthodox, yet easy-to-read, holy texts of almost any religion. The Wayfarer’s Journal reads much like a travelogue, with bits and pieces of trivia mingled with common sense and wisdom for the wanderer. The book is poorly organized, and exists in countless different variations, and no one version is considered better than the others.",
					"Cleric’s Alignment: Although good or lawful good are preferred alignments, unaligned is also permissible.",
					"Duties of the Priesthood: A cleric of Avandra is bound by his beliefs to assist those who have become lost whenever possible, including providing shelter, food, and water. Clerics of Avandra are often called upon to scout trails, explore wilderness regions, and rescue the lost or helpless. Her priests are also called on to encourage tolerance and the pursuit of new experiences, both of which require an open-minded approach to life.",
					"With freedom an important element of Avandra’s faith, her clerics are called upon to do what they can to promote liberty for others. Often, direct confrontation or violence is the wrong answer, but her clerics are encouraged to find other ways to fight for freedom – both their and that of others. This is not to imply that her priests are required to incite revolts and set free criminals; at times, direction action is impractical or unwarranted. Clerics of Avandra must do what they can for individuals, but they do not seek to become rabble-rousers or leaders of some rebellion.",
					"In the case of criminals, they have already made choices to abandon their liberties and freedoms, and as such do not deserve Avandra’s aid. Her concerns are reserved for those without choice or opportunity.",
					"Limitations & Sacrifices: Do not waste resources, do not inflict wanton or meaningless destruction, do not kill unless necessary.",
					"Once per month, clerics of Avandra undergo two days of ritual fasting so that they may better appreciate the plight of the lost and the hungry.",
					"Although clerics of Avandra are not terribly interested or concerned with material possessions, they are encouraged to donate what they can to aid others in need. Too many possessions – even in coin or gems – is a burden to be avoided. Material possessions can easily become distractions or, in the worst case, another form of imprisonment. When an individual focuses too much on possessions, he becomes enslaved to greed and other base emotions."
