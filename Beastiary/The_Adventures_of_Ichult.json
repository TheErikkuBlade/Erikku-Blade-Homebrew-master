No one knew where or how he obtained these dark arts, but legend has it that he retreated from the war to preserve himself, and sank his castle deep underwater.",
					"About 1500 years have passed since that war, and now that the castle has risen again, the return of the old king is soon upon us. He's been resting for over a thousand years, so he may be nowhere near his prime, but it is rumored that he was indeed immortal in age.",

Few existed that could stand in proximity of this mighty warrior of chaos and destruction without losing their very soul to this lich's phylactery.  .\"",

					"\"When he was in power, it is said those who made allies in the war did so because of him. Every nation was struck with fear, and few even dared to attack during the war. He was close to winning the war, but Ishland had united, and that had finally struck fear into him. The elves, the dwarves, and even the humans. Alone they were nothing, together they were a force to be reckoned with. And reckoned with, the king did not.\"",

					"\"I've never seen someone so evil to the very bone... This was no man, he was a monster. Those he didn't kill, he enslaved. He ruled a small country, might as well have been an island... Nobody even knows where he came from, but everyone knew why he wanted to rule.\"",
					"The Retreat of the Mad King",
					"\"Everyone was so happy to see the rotten bastard retreat. Though, I don't blame him. The combined forces of Ishland would be too much for any country. Of course, that didn't last long. They went back to fighting after the king fled. Funny how alliances can end so quickly when the true threat is gone... I wonder if they will ever ally again, or if they'll just destroy each other.\"",

They say he was once within reach of godhood, but was foiled by some adventurers long ago. That new queen of Eastern Ishland... she is a force to be reckoned with. Though most of the other adventurers didn't survive the fight, the queen was able to flee. Maybe it was those adventurers that gave her the opening she needed.\"",
					"Bringer of Chaos:",
					"\"He turned kingdoms to ash, brought warriors to their knees, and champions cowering in fear. Some say he was going to be what brought about the rapture, the beginning of the end. He made several artifacts of war, and even managed to kill a god. He was unmatched by any known creature, and even had an Ancient Dracolich at his beckon call.\"",
					"The Heroes of the Lands:",
					"\"During these times, there were five legendary heroes that attempted to slay the immortal king. Though they failed in their efforts to kill him, they managed to stop his desires to become a god, which would take many years to try and replicate the means to do so. These heroes were were Ragnarok a Wood Elf Sorcerer, Excalibur a Human Paladin, Yumiko a Tiefling Ranger, Kotone an Aasimar Bard, and Iryoku a Dwarf Barbarian. Together with the Queen of Eastern Ishland, they bravely fought against this impossible foe. Many of them gave their lives in this fight, and only the queen was known to escape. It is unknown if the others had, and the powerful weapons they wielded were lost. No one knows of their whereabouts, or if they even still exist.\"",
					"Forgotten Magic",
					"\"Some say that this Lich had untold magic, even beyond what was originally thought to be capable. The epic magic used to make our floating cities pales in comparison to the dark secrets he has. No wonder the mighty heroes fell at the wake of his magic.\""
