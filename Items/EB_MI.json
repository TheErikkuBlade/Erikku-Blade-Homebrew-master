        "This Amulet has three dull gems. When you cast a spell that requires concentration one of the gems begins to glow. While glowing the gem helps hold concentration on the spell, allowing you to concentrate on another spell. When all three gems are glowing, you cannot concentrate on antoher spell.",
        "When you would roll a concentration check to maintain concentration on these spells, if you fail you lose concentration on all of the spells you are concentrating on and the gems become dull again.",
        "If all of the gems started to glow, when they become dull you cannot use the magic from this amulet again until the next dawn."
